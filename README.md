# TDWG Biological Interaction Data Interest Group

## Rationale

Species interaction is a concern in Biology and either in other areas, like Agriculture. Despite many efforts to collect and share species interaction data, its lacks a data standard which allows universally exchange of data and information. Therefore, the goal of this Interest Group is to discuss and formalize biodiversity interaction data aiming at developing a data standard under the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) umbrella.

After a meeting held during the TDWG Conference in Costa Rica, on the 6/Dec/2016, this group was proposed and presented to the TDWG community at the closing session.

## Planned steps

1. Figure out and use a robust theory of biological interactions, including food webs and network ecology concepts. [PLAN_STEP_1](docs/plan/step1.md)
2. Landscaping review: collect information of available resources about species interaction data, study cases and *standard* development, creating a list and providing a detailed description of funcionalities, advantages and disadvantages of each resource. [PLAN_STEP_2](docs/plan/step2.md)
3. Share bibliography references (articles, reports, documents etc.) between collaborators to enrich discussions and promote a standarization of species data.[PLAN_STEP_3](docs/plan/step3.md)
3. Create a **core** standard for species interaction data. [PLAN_STEP_4](docs/plan/step4.md)
4. Development of conceptal models for data centralisation and aggregation. [PLAN_STEP_5](docs/plan/step5.md)

## How to contribute

You can use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tdwg/interaction/issues) to contribute with amendment (including modifications in this text) or starting relevant discussion topics.
